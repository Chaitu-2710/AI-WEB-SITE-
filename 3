4. Implement Logistic regression
Aim:
The aim of this Python program is to demonstrate the implementation of a logistic regression
model.
Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which
predicts the probability that an observation belongs to one of two classes. It is widely used for
binary outcomes in various fields such as medicine, finance, and social sciences.
Software Used: Python 3.7.2
Modules Used: Matplot lib, numpy
Library Used: sklearn-learn
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.randn(200, 2)
y = np.array([1 if x[0] + x[1] > 0 else 0 for x in X])
# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Predict using the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
# Performance evaluation
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
# Plotting the results
plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c=y_test)
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('Logistic Regression Classification')
plt.show()

5. Implement Decision tree induction for classification
Aim:
The aim of this Python program is to demonstrate the implementation of a decision tree induction
model for classification.
Decision Tree
Decision trees are a non-linear predictive modeling tool widely used in data mining and machine
learning. They are particularly useful for handling complex datasets where relationships between
variables are not easily modeled with linear methods.
Software Used: Python 3.7.2
Modules Used: Matplot lib
Library Used: scikit-learn
Program:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import tree
# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
# Create a decision tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# Fit the classifier to the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Predict on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
# Performance evaluation
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
# Plot the decision tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))
tree.plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=iris.feature_names,
class_names=iris.target_names)
plt.title('Decision Tree for Iris Dataset')
plt.show()
